								<p>Hello, My name is Chayne(like ‘Shane’) and I’m a Python Developer. Growing up, I was intrigued with technology and its uses but felt I was afraid of taking the chance and dive deep in learning how to become a creator in this amazing world. 
									I decided to settle into dipping my toes into this world and after graduating in 2016 with my Bachelor’s in Management Information Systems from Florida Atlantic University, I tried using my skills by helping companies become more tech friendly by introducing newer technologies and methods on making companies more efficient. 
									Still with the desire to learn more about technology, I decided to face my fears in 2021 and dedicate all my time into learning my first real programming language Python, and ever since then, I haven’t looked back. I’m excited on what the future will bring when it comes to advancing newer technologies and finding newer ways to change the world!
								</p>
								<p>Little bit about my self: I’m a big foodie, and enjoy cooking from time to time. 
									Being raised in a Jamaican Household, with a culture that takes pride in their culinary ability, I was raised to learn how to cook and living in South Florida that is culturally diverse, being exposed to different foods from other cultures really sparked a love of enjoying the different spices of this world.
